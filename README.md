# Multithreaded API's
This project contains 3 Spring Boot API's that deal with threads to enhance my understanding of how they work, especially in Java. The frontend is in React and uses these API's to display information such as how long it took to process transactions with varying (or static) numbers of threads.

# Future goals
Although I accomplished everything I wanted to, I may in the future add more endpoints or use the existing endpoints to graph the time it took for certain operations for a better understanding of the way threads impact performance.

# How to run
## Start the frontend by
* Navigating to multi-threading/src/main/resources/static/concurrency
* Running "npm start"
## Start the backend by
* Navigating to the file MultiThreadedApisApplication.java in the multithreadedapis folder
* Run this file and the server should start and print "Successfully started server!"
